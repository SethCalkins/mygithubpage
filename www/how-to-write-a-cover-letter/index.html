<p>Whether
you are a seasoned professional looking for new creative opportunities, or a
recent graduate entering the job market, these days you need to know how to write a cover letter if you want to get that dream job. It isn't enough to have a standout
resume or CV. You need an introductory email or cover letter to go with it.</p><p>And
not just an <em>"I'm applying for XYZ job, and here is my resume"</em> email. That misses the point because the combination of a cover letter and resume can be
one of the best ways to market yourself.</p><p>Think
of your cover letter as both tool and opportunity. You want it to make the
hiring manager take notice of you, and gain you a coveted spot on the
to-be-interviewed list. Blow your cover letter, and you risk being screened
out. With the following step-by-step guide, covering both wrong and right ways
for each section, you'll soon master the skill set to craft a perfect cover
letter.</p><p><b><i>The greeting</i></b></p><p><em>“Dear
Hiring Manager”</em> is too generic, and using <em>“Dear Sir”</em> when the person reading
your cover email could be a she is a bad call.</p><p>You
need to find out the name of the person who screens applicants, his or her
title (Ms.? Mr.? Dr.?), as well as his or her position. Usually, a quick web
search yields the information you need. You can also phone the receptionist.</p><p>This
looks much more professional:</p><p><em>“Ms.
Antoinette Nelson</p><p>Manager,
IT Support Services</p><p>Persephone
Corporation”</em></p><p><b><i>Re: the job</i></b></p><p>The
person you are writing to may be recruiting for several positions at once. Make
that person’s life easier. Include a quick reference to the job you’re applying
to upfront. It’s as simple as adding:</p><p><em>“Re:
IT Analyst position</p><p>Dear
Ms. Nelson,”</em> </p><p><b><i>The first
paragraph</i></b></p><p><em>“I’m
applying for the Systems Analyst position”</em> is unnecessary, because it’s obvious
with the <em>“Re: Systems Analyst position.”</em> Besides, that’s boring, and you want
to stand out.</p><p>Instead,
tell why you’re applying for this particular job, in this particular company.
Give a real reason—and one that does not reflect your own self-interest, i.e. the
high salary range being offered. If someone has referred you to a particular
manager, mention her name and company. You are looking to forge a connection
right from the start. If you don’t have a reference, consider leading with a
question: <em>“Are you looking for a proven IT professional? One with cutting-edge
skills and dedication to customer service?”</em> Tell why the position is your dream
job, and why you’re uniquely qualified.</p><p>If
you’re struggling to get the words down, it may be because you haven’t done
your homework. Research the company. Check the news. Find out which charities
they support. You can then admire—and be inspired—by what they do:</p><p><em>“Consuelo
Rivas at SafeTech suggested I get in touch with you. I have long admired what
Persephone is doing in the Twin Cities—working with underprivileged youth—to prepare
them for STEM careers. In fact, my experience with a Persephone mentor now inspires
me to join the tech company that changed my life.”</em></p><p>This
opening paragraph for a recent graduate works because it intrigues and connects
with the hiring manager.</p><p><b><i>The second
paragraph</i></b></p><p>Here’s
where you give a short career summary and you tell the hiring manager why you
should be selected for the job.</p><p><em>“I’m
a recent graduate with a 3.8 GPA” won’t make you stand out. Don’t regurgitate
your resume; the recruiter can read. Your cover letter is made to supplement
your resume, not repeat it.</p><p>Instead,
try telling a story that makes you desirable, that shows you would make a good
addition to the team. Humans are wired to appreciate a good anecdote. If you
make an assertion, support it. If you’ve led a team, what you’ve learned would
make a great example. If your work ethic is superior, or you’ve demonstrated
customer service that went above and beyond, tell that story (bonus if it makes
the recruiter laugh). Comb for resume highlights and explain what one or two of
those experiences taught you.</p><p>If
you don’t have all the requirements for the position, don’t apologize and don’t
mention them. There’s no need to point out potential failings.</p><p>“As
a direct result of that experience, I made better choices as a teenager. I took
all the math and science courses I could, and I made stellar grades. That led
to a full four-year scholarship at Rensselaer, where I stayed an extra year to
get my Master’s Degree. Ms. Rivas supervised me at SafeTech during my summer
internship. She taught me that it takes more than skills and straight A’s to
succeed; it takes total dedication to getting the job done right. I found that
out when I assisted Ms. Rivas for the 17 hours and the 5 lattes it took to
accomplish a tricky database transfer.”</em></p><p>This
paragraph works because it’s personal and it deepens the connection to the
recruiter. It also lets her know that the applicant has figured out what it
takes to advance in her chosen profession.</p><p><b><i>The
conclusion</i></b></p><p>Three
paragraphs are fine. If you’ve done your job with the cover letter, the hiring
manager will want to know you better. The
concluding paragraph gives you the opportunity to seal the deal. This won’t: <em>“I
look forward to hearing from you.”</em></p><p>Why?
It’s reactive rather than proactive. It says you’ll wait to hear from the
recruiter. Instead, show you’re a go-getter. In today’s tight job market, words
do count. The hiring company needs employees who can communicate clearly and
concisely. Your cover letter then serves two purposes; it introduces you and it
passes that test (the one you probably didn’t know you were taking).</p><p>Here’s
a better way:</p><p><em>“I’d
love to show you what I can do. I’ll call Thursday morning next week. You can
reach me at 612/555-6162, or at betinaduran@gmail.com. Thank you for your time
and consideration—and for being a company that cares about children.”</em></p><p>Not
only has the applicant thanked the manager for her time and consideration, but she
did it in a way that demonstrates her passion and commitment. You can do the
same thing, by choosing your verbs carefully (“love” conquers “like”). The
applicant remembered to include contact information, so the hiring manager
doesn’t have to go searching for it. And she promised to follow up. Finally,
she has connected once more and shows that she is future-thinking.</p><p>The
most desirable employee is always going to be one that learns fast, who can quickly
adapt to new technologies coming down the pike, and who looks for the better
answer instead of the easy one.</p><p>Following
are a few more housekeeping tips which will ensure your cover letter reflects you in your
best light.</p><p><b><i>Read your
letter out loud</i></b></p><p>Does
it flow? Did you stumble over a long-winded sentence? Your sentences should
have varied structure. Did your (winning) personality come through? Does it
sound like you? And most importantly, did you communicate why the company needs
you rather than the other way around?</p><p><b><i>Proofreading
makes the difference</i></b></p><p>It’s
not enough to run your cover letter through the spell-checker (although you
should). It won’t catch every mistake or typo. These are common usage errors:
confusion over its/it’s, there/their/they’re, your/you’re, affect/effect, and insure/ensure.
If grammar isn’t your thing, give the letter to a friend to review.</p><p>Check
your verbs. Are they active voice or passive voice (overusing was)? Some great
active verbs are: create, launch, navigate, analyze, rescue, and organize. If
they seem familiar, it’s because they’re the verbs that resonate on your resume
or CV.</p><p>Check
your descriptions. Words that will make you sound great are integrity,
enthusiastic, committed. Avoid saying “I’m responsible,” or any other platitude
that the hiring manager would expect. Avoid clichés—find a fresher way to say
what you mean. Too many superlative adjectives may cause eye rolls.</p><p><b><i>Keywords
count</i></b></p><p>If
the company is hiring for a position that requires a certain skill set, use
those exact keywords, in the exact order, in your email. These days,
particularly at large companies, applicant-tracking software is frequently
used, and the program is searching for those keywords. If it doesn’t find them,
your email and resume won’t go any further. Do your best to insert the keywords
organically.</p><p><b><i>Take the
time to do it right</i></b></p><p>Don’t
use the same cover letter for everyone, only altering the heading, the greeting, and the position you're applying for. It risks reading as generic. Remember, your introductory email needs
to be personal and connect with the reader. An investment of thirty minutes,
both to research and tailor that cover letter, will be time well spent.</p><p><b><i>Sample cover
email</i></b></p><p><em>Ms. Antoinette Nelson</br>Manager, IT Services</br>Persephone Corporation</p><p>Re:
IT Analyst position</p><p>Dear
Ms. Nelson,</p><p>Consuelo
Rivas at SafeTech suggested I get in touch with you. I have long admired what
Persephone is doing in the Twin Cities—working with underprivileged youth—to prepare
them for STEM careers. In fact, my experience with a Persephone mentor now inspires
me to join the tech company that changed the course of my life.</p><p>As
a direct result of that experience, I made better choices as a teenager. I took

love to show you what I can do. I’ll call Thursday morning next week. You can
reach me at 612/555-6162, or at betinaduran@gmail.com. Thank you for your time
and consideration—and for being a company that cares about children. Someday (maybe soon?) I hope to be in a position to be a mentor.</p><p>Best
wishes,</p><p>Betina
Duran</em></p><p><b><i>Final advice</i></b> </p><p>Remember, a perfect cover letter is your chance to express your personality. By making a connection, it should convince the hiring manager that you would make a fantastic addition to the team. Following these tips, you'll know how to write a cover letter for a resume. Do it right, and you'll be one step closer to landing that perfect job. </p> </br></br>
