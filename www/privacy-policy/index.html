<p>Last Updated on: June 9, 2016</p>

<p>At Workstory Inc. (“Workstory”, “we”, “us”, “our”) we recognize that you are concerned about your personal information and how it is collected, stored, used, and disclosed. We respect your concerns and this Privacy Notice gives you the information you need about how your personal information is collected, managed, and disclosed by Workstory as you interact with the VisualCV.com and Workstory.com websites (the “Websites”) so you can make informed decisions as you provide it to us. We urge you to read it carefully and ask us if you do not understand something. </p>

<p>By registering on this Website, by submitting your resume information or any other information through the use of this Website, or by otherwise accessing this Website or using any of our services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Notice and consent to the policies and practices described for the collection, use, storage, or disclosure of your personal information. </p>

<p>Our Website is not intended for the use by children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13 stop now and do not provide us with any information. We will delete any information we believe is related to a child under the age of 13.<p>

<h4>A.	Changes to this Privacy Notice</h4>

<p>1. Workstory reserves the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Notice at any time. If we make any material change to this Privacy Notice, we will update this Website to include such changes and post a notice on our home page, for a period of 30 days, with a link to the updated Privacy Notice. Please read any such notice and the new Privacy Notice. If you return to this site after a period of more than 30 days, please check this Privacy Notice to confirm that you are aware of the details of the most recent update. Please look at the top of this Privacy Notice to check the date that it was last updated and to confirm that you are familiar with the terms of the most recent update. Except as described in paragraph 2 below, your continued use of this Website after we post such notice will constitute your acceptance of the new terms and their application to your use of this Website and the personal information disclosed for such use, including personal information previously furnished us, as if they were the initial terms, and your consent to the use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy and elsewhere on our Website. </p>
<p>2.	If we are making a change to this Privacy Notice related to the disclosure of your personal information to additional third parties or to allow for additional uses by us of your personal information we will ask you for your explicit consent for such change. </p>
<h4>B.	A Brief Comment on Global Privacy Laws and What Law You Are Agreeing to Use </h4>

<p>1.	Just as different individuals have different views over their personal information, what they are concerned about, how they protect it, and who they share it with, so have different governments enacted a variety of laws that touch on personal information and how it should be managed by entities other than youself. Naturally these laws are different, inconsistent, and have varying degrees of applicability to your use of our Website. They also do not easily adapt to the reality of a global internet where you may live in any country in the world, Workstory is based in Canada, and we may host our actual application and store your personal information in Canada, the United States, a member of the European Union, or some other country using third parties to provide various services to us to provide the Website and its functionality. </p>
<p>2.	To make easier for both of us to understand our obligations and rights, by agreeing to this Privacy Notice you are agreeing that we both are adopting the Canadian laws in the Province of British Columbia that are applicable to Workstory to govern this Privacy Notice and your rights related to the policies and practices that are described in it, regardless of what country you live in or what country Workstory, or any third party providing services to Workstory, uses to store, process, gather, host, or any of the other actions taken related to your personal information Workstory obtains as a result of your use of the Website.</p>
<p>3.	This means that you are explicitly agreeing to the transfer of your personal information from your home country to a third country or countries which may include the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>4.	This means that you are agreeing that Workstory may process your information using third party sub-processors located in any country so long as Workstory ensures that those third party sub-processors abide by this Privacy Notice and Workstory is responsible to you if they break their obligations in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>5.	You should be aware that when your information is located or stored in a particular jurisdiction (for example the United States), the laws of that jurisdiction will apply to the ability of that government and law enforcement to access your personal information without your consent. The laws of that jurisdiction and the protections related to your personal information may not be as rigorous as the laws in the country you live in.</p>
<h4>C.	What Does Canadian Law Require Workstory to Do?</h4>

<p>1.	Canadian law governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in a manner that recognizes a individuals' right of privacy with respect to their personal information.</p>
<p>2.	Canada has two levels of government, Federal and Provincial. Federal privacy law applies unless a Province has enacted equivalent privacy law. Workstory is based in British Columbia which has enacted the Personal Information Privacy Act (“PIPA”) which sets out rules and principles for the management of personal information by commercial organizations. Because Workstory is based in British Columbia, PIPA will apply to this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>3.	PIPA provides certain fundamental principles that apply to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. One of the most significant, is that your personal information generally cannot be collected, used or disclosed without your consent. It also allows you to find out why your personal information is being collected, how it is being used, where it's being stored and to whom it's disclosed. It requires the use of appropriate safeguards to secure your personal information. It also grants you access to your personal information and provides mechanisms for ensuring compliance. It also provides for the circumstances where your information may be disclosed without your consent (things like law enforcement, to complete a contractual request, or to protect life).</p>
<p>4.	Workstory does not collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent except where required or allowed by law.</p>
<h4>D.	What Information Does Workstory Collect?</h4>

<p>1.	We collect two types of information when you interact with the Website: personal information (“Personal Information”) and everything else. Personal Information is information that relates to you and can be used by itself or in combination with other information to identify you. Some Personal Information is obvious such as your government identification number, however other information that is Personal Information is somewhat subtle. As you add information together you can create a package of information that will identify someone and so together would be considered Personal Information. For example the following information: Law Degree, 2001, Yale, employed at Seyfarth Shaw, born in Cleveland, and works in Chicago, may not individually be Personal Information, but certainly taken as a whole would identify someone and therefore would be Personal Information. Because of this we treat all of your resume information as Personal Information.</p>
<p>2.	We also collect some data that is in the grey zone of Personal Information like the IP address from which you access our Website, or information from Cookies (see the section on Cookies below) that allow us to provide you with enhanced functionality or assist us in operating our Website. For the purposes of this Privacy Notice we will treat those items as if it is your Personal Information.</p>
<p>3.	The information that is not Personal Information (everything else) mostly consists of aggregated usage information, web site pages visited, and technical information like the internet browser used, os version used, screen resolution etc.  that we use to operate and improve the Website.</p>
<p>4.	If you are paying us for use of certain features of the Website, we will use a third party payment processor (“Payment Service”) to collect the payments. When making a payment you will be directed to a web page hosted and controlled by the Payment Service. Any Personal Information you provide the Payment Service is being provided to the Payment Service and not Workstory and would be subject to the Privacy Notice of the Payment Service alone.</p>
<p>5.	You can visit this site without telling us who you are and without providing us with any information about yourself. However, certain anonymous information may be collected automatically as you navigate through the site or use our services, including usage details, sites visited prior to visiting our site, IP addresses and information collected through cookies Pixel Tags, and other tracking technologies. Some of this information would become your Personal Information were you to subsequently register with us.</p>
<h4>E.	Use of Cookies and Pixel Tags</h4>

<p>1.	We and our service providers may use “cookies” on the Site. Cookies are small files that a web server transfers to an individual’s computer for identification purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most web sites and can facilitate users’ ongoing access to and use of a particular web site; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. We use cookies to improve your experience interacting with our Website or in it’s operation. If you would like more information on cookies we suggest you go to the website allaboutcookies.org. </p>
<p>2.	 If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer, or erasing cookies from your computer. Our Website will operate if you decline to receive “third party” cookies from us, however we require “first party” cookies to be accepted for the website to work if you are (or plan to be) a registered user of our services.</p>
<p>3.	We and our service providers may also use so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags“) in connection with some Website pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Website usage and response rates and to facilitate our advertising of our services at other websites you may visit. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1×1), that is ordinarily not visible to a Website visitor and may be associated with Cookies on the visitor’s computer. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns, and to show you targeted advertising related to our services when you visit other websites. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened.</p>
<h4>F.	How Does Workstory Use Information?</h4>

<p>1.	We use the information you provide to:</p>

<div class="indented"> 
<p>1.1 Fulfill the purpose for which you provided the information to us. For example: to complete your purchase, build your profile, have your credentials certified, have your resume reviewed by a career management professional, or publish your resume online. This type of use also covers your instructions to us to provide your information to a third party you identify to us.</p>

<p> 1.2.	We may select your public resume (which you have chosen to make public) as an example resume to show to other users of our Website for educational purposes.</p> 
<p>1.3.	To facilitate our communications either through the Website or by email to the email address you provide us. Note that by providing us with your email address you have explicitly consented to the receipt of email messages from us, related to your use of the Website and marketing offers we may make to you. While you can unsubscribe to marketing emails, you cannot opt out of receiving emails related to your use of the Website. </p> 
<p>1.4.	If you choose to do so, you may receive messages from other Website users relating to areas of interest that you select. We do not provide your Personal Information to such other users—rather, the message from the user is sent to a group of people, including you, based on demographic information and the areas of interest you and the others in the group have selected, and you can decide whether to respond to the message or delete it.</p> 
<p>1.5.	To send targeted advertising to you related to our services when you visit other websites. Note that we may not know who you are when we advertise as you may have only visited our website and not registered on it.</p>
<p>1.6.	To operate our business. This means such items as data analysis, audits, order fulfillment tracking, enhancing our web site, improving our services and identifying usage trends.</p>

</div>

<h4>G.	How is Your Personal Information Disclosed?</h4>

<p>1.	<em>We Don’t Commercialize your Information.</em> We do not sell, trade, rent, or license the personal information you provide us, whether to marketing list makers, advertisers, or anyone else.</p>
<p>2.	<em>To Our Third Party Service Providers. </em>We work with third parties to provide the various services and features of the Website and the other services that we provide. This includes: hosting, data processing, data analysis, order fulfillment, career management, and other services of an administrative nature. We provide your Personal Information with such third parties in order to provide the Website and services. As mentioned above, those third parties may exist or provide the services in any country and we have no restriction on what country we transfer your information to for the processing, recognizing that we are responsible for our third party service providers we transfer information to to comply with this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>3.	<em> To Third Parties on Your Request.</em> You can instruct us to transfer your information to a third party or make it available to third parties because of the settings you have chosen in your use of the Website, for example publishing your resume as a webpage, either public or private where you selectively share the URL. Note that the default account settings maintain your information as a private webpage. If you publish your resume freely on the web we cannot restrict what third parties will have access to it. It also may be cached in various online services even if you change or delete it. We have no control over how third parties (i) you instruct us to transfer information to, or (ii) who access your information because of your account settings, deal with your information. Once the information in in the hands of such third parties this Privacy Notice no longer applies and we are not responsible for the actions of such third parties.</p>
<p>4.	 <em>To Third Parties Related to Our Business.</em> We can transfer your information to any third party in the event of a reorganization, merger, sales, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock. The third party that we transfer the information to will be responsible to you to process your information in accordance with this Privacy Notice once that transfer is made. We can also disclose your information to any third party advisors (accountants, auditors, lawyers, investment bankers, lenders, etc.) related to such actions or who are engaged to assist us in the usual operation of our business. We are responsible to ensure that third party advisors act consistently with this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>5.	<em>To Third Parties in Accordance with Laws and Rights.</em> We can transfer your information to a third party (a) as authorized in applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to a government or regulatory request; (d) to enforce the Terms of Service of our Website; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of us, you, or others; and (g) to permit us to pursue legal remedies or limit the damages we may sustain.</p>
<h4>H.	Links to Third Party sites</h4>

<p>1.	Our Website may provide you with hyper-links to third party sites. These third party sites are not under our control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on our Website does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us. If you provide any of your personal information to such third party website that information will be collected and controlled by the privacy notice of that third party and not by this Privacy Notice.</p>
<h4>I.	Security </h4>

<p>1.	One of our obligations to you under Canadian Law is to provide reasonable security over your Personal Information we process. We have put in place an information security program to manage how we secure your information. This program covers such areas as:</p>
	<div class="indented"> 
	<p>1.1.	How we design our Website for security;</p>
	<p>1.2.	How we test our Website to discover security flaws;</p>
	<p>1.3.	How we host our product to limit vulnerabilities including: processes and procedures, server hardening, and operating system patching; </p>
	<p>1.4.	How we hire and train our staff, contractually impose confidentiality obligations on them, and restrict their access to your information to only what is necessary as part of their job;</p>
	<p>1.5.	How we interact with third parties who are providing services to us including the terms of the contracts we have with them;</p>
	<p>1.6.	How our administrative processes are set up for such things as password resets and verifying who we are communicating with;</p>
	<p>1.7.	How we respond to suspicious events and manage an incident should one happen; and </p>
	<p>1.8.	How we plan for disasters and how we continue to operate should one occur. </div> 

<p>2.	Unfortunately, no information security program can absolutely guarantee that an unauthorized person will not obtain access to your information. Our sole obligation to you is to perform our information security program and update it in accordance with good industry practice. 
v3.	Remember that the main way that unauthorized third parties obtain access to personal information is by obtaining access credentials. So please use a unique, strong password for your account on the Website. Also, be aware that phishing emails often install software to enable the obtaining of your user name and passwords to the various sites you use, including our Website. You need to be aware when you use the internet. We will never ask you to confirm your user id and password by email or send you an embedded link to our Website. If you receive such an email, we ask that you contact our Privacy Officer so we are informed and we can take appropriate actions to inform all of our users.
<p>4.	Emails should not be considered secure so keep this in consideration when sending us email.
<p>5.	Should we discover an unauthorized third party obtain access to any of your personal information we will inform you once we confirm that this has occurred. 
<h4>J.	Accessing and Changing Your Information</h4>
<p>1.	We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Information is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is appropriate for its purposes.</p>
<p>2.	You have full control over accessing and changing most of your Personal Information directly through the Website. For your Personal Information that is not directly accessible by you (mostly related to your account administration) you may contact us by contacting our Privacy Officer as described below. Upon request made in writing, we will inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your Personal Information, at minimal or no cost to you, in accordance with processes and procedures that we have put in place for such requests. If you are unsure whether we have a record containing your information and would like to confirm what Information we have, please contact our Privacy Officer as set forth below, identifying all email addresses which you may have given us. If there is a cost involved at all, we will inform you at that time. We will provide access to the executor of your estate should you die upon proof of both your death and the appointment (and identity) of the executor which is reasonable to us.</p>
<p>3.	We may require additional information from you in order to verify your identity following an access request. Such personal information will only be used for the purpose of identity verification and will itself be subject to protection under the terms of this Privacy Notice. We will respond to all requests for access within 30 days of receipt or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
<p>4.	In some circumstances, we may not be able to provide access to all of the Information that we hold about you. We may not provide access to Information if doing so would likely reveal Information about a third party, could be expected to threaten the life or security of an individual, reveal confidential commercial information, if the Information is protected by a legally recognized privilege, if it was created as part of a settlement or dispute resolution process, or if it was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law. We will provide reasons to you if it refuses an access request. 

<h4>K.	Retention of Your Information </h4> 

<p>1.	You may choose to delete your information from your account at any time. When you do this we will retain your information <!-- for up to 6 months --> solely to enable you to change your mind and restore your account. None of your information will be accessible by you or the public. Deleting your information will not remove information we use to administer your account which we will retain until we delete it in accordance with our internal record keeping policy. We will also delete your information in accordance with our policies related to inactive accounts. 

<!-- Currently if you have not logged into your account for 2 years we will mark your account as inactive and delete your information 6 months following it being so marked. --> </p>
<p>2.	When we delete your information we will do so in a secure manner in accordance with good industry practices. </p>
<h4>L.	Contacting Us</h4>

<p>1.	If you have a question or concern about this Privacy Notice or how your personal information is being handled by Workstory please contact us. Please make any communication to the attention of “Privacy Officer” and we will acknowledge, record, investigate, and respond to you in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>2.	Remember that email is not secure so you should be thoughtful about including any Personal Information in your emails to us.</p>
<p>3.	Our Privacy Officer’s address is: </p>

<h4>VisualCV is a business of Workstory Inc.</h4>
<p>VisualCV(&#8220;<b>VisualCV</b>,&#8221; &#8220;<b>we</b>,&#8221; &#8220;<b>us</b>&#8220;) is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy (the &#8220;<b>Policy</b>&#8220;) describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through our web site located at<a style="color: #274665;" href="../../index.html" >https://www.visualcv.com</a> (the &#8220;<b>Site</b>&#8220;). This Policy does not govern our collection of information through any web site, or by any other means, other than through the Site or by third parties.</p>
<p>By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior notice. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the &#8220;<i><span class="cap">LAST UPDATED</span></i>&#8221; legend at the bottom of this page. Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect.</p>
<p>The Site is controlled and operated by VisualCV from the United States, and is not intended to subject VisualCV to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.</p>
<p><b>1. What Types of Information Does VisualCV Collect From Me?</b></p>
<p class="indent_1">VisualCV gathers two basic types of information through the Site: <b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>&#8221; (or &#8220;<b>PII</b>&#8220;) and &#8220;<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>&#8221; (or &#8220;<b>Non-PII</b>&#8220;). Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.</p>
<p class="indent_2"><b>a. Personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>
<p class="indent_3">You do not have to provide PII to use the Site. In order to set up your own VisualCV (as defined in Section 3.b below), we require you to provide minimal PII, such as your name as well as an active email address we can verify. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to view certain areas of the Site), we may require that you furnish additional PII. We collect PII from you through the Site, such as your name, alias, postal address, telephone number, email address, profession, industry knowledge, resume information including: contact information, career summary, career objective, work history, educational history, skills, certifications, clearances, references, as well as portfolio information containing PII you may want to attach in your communications including: documents, multimedia items such as video or audio clips or photographs, charts, and external links to PII you wish to reference, only when you voluntarily provide it to us.</p>
<p class="indent_3">Please note that we use a third-party payment service (the “<b>Payment Service</b>”) to collect payments made through the Site (for example, payments for services you purchase through the Site). If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you will be directed to a web page hosted by such Payment Service (or its service providers) and not by VisualCV (the “<b>Payment Service Page</b>”). Any PII that you provide through the Payment Service Page will be collected by the Payment Service and not by VisualCV, and will be subject to the Payment Service’s privacy policy, not this Policy. VisualCV has no control over, and shall not be responsible for, the Payment Service’s use of information collected through the Payment Service. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE PAYMENT SERVICE PAGE OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF THE PAYMENT SERVICE.</p>
<p class="indent_2"><b>b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>
<p class="indent_3">When you visit and interact with the Site, VisualCV and third parties with whom VisualCV has contracted to provide services to VisualCV may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visited). Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from five different sources: server log files, environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.</p>
<p class="indent_4" style="font-weight: bold;">i. Server Log Files.</p>
<p class="indent_5">Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site&#8217;s servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.</p>
<p class="indent_4" style="font-weight: bold;">ii. Environmental Variables.</p>
<p class="indent_5">We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.</p>
<p class="indent_4" style="font-weight: bold;">iii. Cookies.</p>
<p class="indent_5">We and our service providers may use “cookies” on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual&#8217;s computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most web sites and can facilitate users&#8217; ongoing access to and use of a particular web site; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer.</p>
<p class="indent_4" style="font-weight: bold;">iv. Pixel Tags.</p>
<p class="indent_5">We and our service providers may also use so-called &#8220;pixel tags,&#8221; &#8220;web beacons,&#8221; &#8220;clear GIFs&#8221; or similar means (collectively, &#8220;<b>Pixel Tags</b>&#8220;) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1&#215;1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened.</p>
<p class="indent_4" style="font-weight: bold;">v. Information That You Voluntarily Provide.</p>
<p class="indent_5">VisualCV also collects Non-PII (<i>e.g.</i>, your interests, your geographic location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information is not combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it does not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy.</p>
<p><b>2. How Does VisualCV Use Information Collected From Me?</b></p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>a. Personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">We may use your PII in the following ways:</p>
<p class="indent_2"><b>i. Fulfillment of Requests.</b></p>
<p class="indent_3">VisualCV may use your PII to fulfill the purpose for which such PII was provided (for example to fulfill your purchase, build a profile, have your education credentials certified or have a career management professional review your VisualCV).</p>
<p class="indent_2"><b>ii. Administrative Communications.</b></p>
<p class="indent_3">From time to time, at our sole discretion, we may use your PII to send to you important information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.</p>
<p class="indent_2"><b>iii. Marketing Communications.</b></p>
<p class="indent_3">If you affirmatively opt-in, we may use your PII to inform you of products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p class="indent_2"><b>iv. Interests.</b></p>
<p class="indent_3">If you choose to do so, you may receive messages from other Site users relating to certain areas of interest that you select. We do not provide your PII to such other users—rather, the message from the user is sent to a group of people, including you, based on demographic information and the areas of interest you and the others in the group have selected, and you can decide whether to respond to the message or delete it.</p>
<p class="indent_2"><b>v. Promotions.</b></p>
<p class="indent_3">We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, &#8220;<b>Promotions</b>&#8220;) through the Site. We typically ask you for certain PII when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about VisualCV&#8217;s use of your PII. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your PII conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.</p>
<p class="indent_2"><b>vi. Internal Business Purposes.</b></p>
<p class="indent_3">We may also use your PII for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, order fulfillment tracking, enhancing our web site, improving our services and identifying usage trends.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non‑PII, which does not personally identify you with third parties for any purpose.</p>
<p class="indent_2">In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as embedding email addresses in cookies). If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII hereunder as long as it is so combined (see Section 2.a above).</p>
<p><b>3. How Is Personally Identifiable Information Collected on the Site Disclosed?</b></p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>a. Third-Party Service Providers.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to data analysis, order fulfillment, career management and other services of an administrative nature. We reserve the right to share your PII with such third parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide such services (for example, if you choose to have your education credentials certified or have a career management professional review your VisualCV through the Site, we may provide your PII to a third-party service provider to allow the provider to perform the selected service).</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>b. Promotions.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">We reserve the right to share the PII you provide in connection with Promotions with third-party sponsors of such Promotions (irrespective of whether such Promotions are hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about a sponsor&#8217;s or other third parties’ use of your PII. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your PII conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>c. VisualCV.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">We provide functionality on the Site that allows you to create an electronic profile, which includes enhanced features determined by VisualCV (each such electronic profile, a “<b>VisualCV&#8221;</b>) and post certain information and materials on your VisualCV. Please note that your VisualCV, including the PII available in your VisualCV, may be accessible to other users when you allow such other users to view your VisualCV, or parts thereof (for example, if you wish to make your VisualCV available for view by particular companies). We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your PII, or any other information, in your VisualCV. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY PII YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR VISUALCV. Additionally, please be aware that if you review a VisualCV that an individual has submitted to you, the individual will be able to see that you have reviewed his or her VisualCV.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>d. Forums.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">VisualCV may make available through the Site services (for example, message boards and listservs, among other services) to which you are able to post information and materials (each, a “<b>Forum</b>”). Please note that the Forums may be provided by a third-party forum service, and not by us, and thus, the use of your PII by the third-party forum service will be governed by such third party’s privacy policy, not this Policy. Please note that any information you disclose through a Forum becomes public information and may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public. In addition, when you choose to make a posting on such services, certain PII (such as your user name) will be available for other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your PII, or any other information, through a Forum. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PII YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH A FORUM.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>e. Third-Party Communications.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">If you affirmatively opt-in, we may share your PII with third parties to allow them to contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions that they believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>f. Assignment.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from Site users to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of VisualCV&#8217;s business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>g. Law enforcement; emergencies; compliance.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose your PII to others as we believe to be appropriate (a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to governmental requests; (d) to enforce our Terms of Service; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of VisualCV, you or others; and (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</p>
<p><b>4. Other Important Notices Regarding Our Privacy Practices.</b></p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>a. Regarding the Use of the Site by Children.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personally Identifiable Information through the Site.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>b. Third-Party Sites.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">The Site may contain links to third-party web sites. These linked sites are not under VisualCV&#8217;s control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by VisualCV. If you provide any PII through any such third-party web site, your transaction will occur on such third party&#8217;s web site (not the Site) and the PII you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>c. Third-Party Advertisers.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">We may use third-party advertisement-serving companies (“<b>Advertisers</b>”) to serve advertisements on the Site. Please be advised that such Advertisers may use cookies, Pixel Tags and other technologies to, among other things, enable such Advertisers to monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which Site pages you were viewing when such ads were delivered. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY ADVERTISERS.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>d. Security.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">We have security measures and tools, such as firewalls, in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Site or that is stored by us. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with Section 4.h (&#8220;<i>Contacting Us,</i>&#8220;) below (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>e. Opt-Out.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">As noted above, if you expressly opt-in, we may send you<b> </b>marketing-related email messages. Additionally, as noted above, if you expressly opt-in, we may share your PII with third parties for their marketing purposes. If, after you have opted in, you change your mind and you no longer wish to receive marketing-related emails from us and/or you do not want us to share your email address with third parties for such third parties&#8217; marketing purposes, you may opt-out of receiving such marketing-related emails and/or from such sharing by selecting the appropriate opt-out check box located on your ‘My Profile’ page.</p>
<p class="indent_2">We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your PII from the databases of third parties with which we have already shared your PII (i.e., to which we have already provided your PII as of the date that we implement your opt-out request). If you wish to cease receiving marketing-related emails from such third parties, please contact such third parties directly or utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing-related emails.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>f. Changing or Removing Your PII.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">If you would like to review, correct, update or remove PII that you have previously provided to us through the Site, you may do so by visiting the following locations within the Site: 1) ‘My Profile’ located on the ‘My VisualCVs’ page and 2) Contact Information within the Resume Sections area of each VisualCV that you create.</p>
<p class="indent_2">Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed therefrom. We also reserve the right, from time to time, to re-contact former users of the Site. Finally, we are not responsible for removing information from the databases of third parties with whom we have already shared your PII.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>g. Jurisdictional Issues.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">VisualCV does not represent or warrant that the Site, or any part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their
 own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit the Site&#8217;s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and at our sole discretion.</p>
<p class="indent_1"><b>h. Contacting Us.</b></p>
<p class="indent_2">If you have any questions regarding this Policy, please contact us by email at <a style="color: #274665;" href="mailto:info@visualcv.com">info@visualcv.com</a>. Please note that email communications will not necessarily be secure; accordingly you should not include credit card information or other sensitive information in your email correspondence with us.</p>
