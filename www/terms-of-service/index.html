Any in-person appearances requested by the arbitrator shall be held in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The arbitrator&#8217;s decision shall be based upon the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to its principles of conflicts of law. Arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English and shall be conducted in a manner that preserves confidentiality. The arbitrator&#8217;s decision shall follow the plain meaning of the relevant documents and shall be final and binding. The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude VisualCV from seeking any injunctive relief in U.S. state or federal courts for protection of its intellectual property rights (including the rights of its licensors), and you agree to exclusive jurisdiction by the federal and state courts located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.<br /><br />
<strong>19. Miscellaneous.</strong> This Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and VisualCV. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior written consent. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. This, together with all policies referred to herein, is the entire Agreement between you and VisualCV relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings between you and VisualCV relating to such subject matter. Notices to you may be made via posting to the Site, by email, or by regular mail, at VisualCV’s discretion. The Site may also provide notices of changes to this Agreement or other matters by displaying such notices or by providing links to such notices. Without limitation, you agree that a printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. VisualCV will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.<br /><br />
<strong>20. Filtering.</strong> Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d) as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available at GetNetWise (http://kids.getnetwise.org/) and OnGuard Online (http://onguardonline.gov/). Please note that VisualCV does not endorse any of the products or services listed at such sites.<br /><br />
<strong>21. Information or Complaints.</strong> Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California users are entitled to the following consumer rights notice: If you have a question or complaint regarding the Site, please send an email to info@visualcv.com. You may also contact us by writing to #300-10991 Shellbridge Way, Richmond, BC, V6X 3C6, Canada, or by calling us at +1-571-299-2000.

<strong>22. Claims of Copyright Infringement.</strong> The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send VisualCV a notice requesting that VisualCV remove the material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send VisualCV a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices should be mailed to: VisualCV #300-10991 Shellbridge Way, Richmond, BC, V6X 3C6, Canada. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.<br /><br />
